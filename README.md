# learn-react
Just learning React I guess...

# my cheat sheet:

## CSS
* `div p` means p inside div (space means inside works for classes too as `.first .second`
* `.first.second` means has classes `first` and `second` at the same time
* `.first,.second` means has class `first` or `second` (works for html attribute types too `div, p`)
* we can mix different types of selectors at the same time: `div .first` (div and has a class first) [this works with id too]
## React snippets extension

* `rafc` reactArrowFunctionComponent (will create one with the name of the file) but without export
* `rafce` with export (use this for new files for now I guess?)
* `impt` imports propTypes
